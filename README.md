ðŸŒŸ Welcome to Your Helpful Python Bot! ðŸŒŸ
This bot is designed to provide you with coding advice right in your console. Follow the steps below to get started and interact with the bot using the OpenAI API.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+: Ensure Python is installed. Download Python

OpenAI API Key: Sign up and get your API key from OpenAI's Website.

ðŸš€ Setup Instructions
Get your API Key:

Rename the file .env.example to .env.

Open the .env file in the project directory.

Replace your-api-key-here with your actual OpenAI API key:

plaintext

Copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Create a Virtual Environment:

Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted project directory:

bash

Copy
cd path/to/console_bot_v1
Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

bash

Copy
python -m venv venv
Move the Bot File:

Move terminal_bot.py inside the venv folder.

Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:

bash

Copy
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

bash

Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Packages:

With your virtual environment activated, install the dependencies:

bash

Copy
pip install openai python-dotenv
Run the Bot:

Change to the venv directory:

bash

Copy
cd venv
Start the chatbot by running:

bash

Copy
python terminal_bot.py
To exit, type exit and press Enter.

ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting
Python Not Recognized: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH. Run python --version to check. If not found, reinstall Python and add it to PATH.

Virtual Environment Activation Fails: Make sure you're in the correct directory and use the right command for your OS. On Windows, try using Command Prompt or PowerShell with Administrator rights.

Module Not Found Error: Ensure the virtual environment is activated and run pip install openai python-dotenv again.

API Key Issues: Double-check your API key in the .env file for any extra spaces or characters.

Network Errors: Ensure a stable internet connection. If behind a firewall/proxy, allow connections to OpenAIâ€™s services.

Permission Issues: On Windows, run your terminal as an administrator. On macOS/Linux, confirm you have necessary file permissions.

ðŸ’¡ General Tips
Clear pip cache and update dependencies if issues persist:

bash

Copy
pip cache purge
pip install --upgrade openai python-dotenv
Check OpenAIâ€™s official documentation for updates.
